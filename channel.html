title: Unified Async/WebSocket API

<h2>Unified Async/Websocket API</h2>

<p>This page talks about the async and websocket extension for real-time application. Using the latest and greatest:</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
[http-kit "2.5.3"] ; Add to your project.clj
http-kit/http-kit {:mvn/version "2.5.3"} ; for deps.edn

(:use org.httpkit.server) ; import namespace{% endhighlight %}

<p class="note">
  The API is still working in progress, but is fully working.
  If interested, use <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/issues">GitHub issues page</a> for suggestions, bug reports, or general discussions.
  Please refer <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/blob/protocol-api/src/org/httpkit/server.clj">server.clj</a> more detail, it has pretty clear docstr.
</p>

<p class="note">
  This API is not compatible with `2.0.0-rc4`.
</p>

<h3 id="motivation" class="anchor">Motivation</h3>

<p>Why a new API</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simpler and more consistent than previous one</li>
  <li>New feature: HTTP streaming</li>
  <li>Unify the API for HTTP (streaming or long-polling) and WebSocket: allow gracefully degrading to long-polling/streaming when WebSocket is not available in client</li>
  <li>Sever also get notified when client close/away for long-polling/streaming</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protocol" class="anchor">Channel Protocol</h3>

<p>Unified asynchronous channel interface for HTTP (streaming or long-polling) and WebSocket.</p>

Channel defines the following contract:
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>open?</code>: Returns true iff channel is open.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>close</code>: Closes the channel. Idempotent: returns true if the channel was actually closed, or false if it was already closed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>websocket?</code>: Returns true iff channel is a WebSocket.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>send!</code>:
    Sends data to client and returns true if the data was successfully sent,
    or false if the channel is closed. Data is sent directly to the client,
    NO RING MIDDLEWARE IS APPLIED.

    Data form: {:headers _ :status _ :body _} or just body. Note that :headers
    and :status will be stripped for WebSocket and for HTTP streaming responses
    after the first.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-receive</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [message-string]) for notification of client WebSocket
    messages. Message ordering is guaranteed by server.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-close</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [status]) for notification of channel being closed by the
    server or client. Handler will be invoked at most once. Useful for clean-up
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-channel" class="anchor">Get the channel</h3>

<p>A macro <code>with-channel</code> is provided, example: </p>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [req]
  (with-channel req channel ;; get the channel,
    ;; channel can be HTTP(long-polling, streaming) or Websocket
    ;; manipulate them with a unified API
    ))
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="polling" class="anchor">Long polling example</h3>

<p>long polling is very much like streaming</p>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (on-some-event ;; wait for event
     (send! channel {:status 200
                     :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json; charset=utf-8"}
                     :body "hello, polling"}
            true))))  ; send! and close. just be explicit, true is the default for streaming/polling,

(run-server handler {:port 9090})
{% endhighlight %}


<h3 id="streaming" class="anchor">Streaming example</h3>
{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (on-close channel (fn [status] (println "closed by sever, or client")))
    (loop [id 0]
      (when (< id 10)
        (schedule-task (* id 200) ;; sent a message every 200ms
                       (send! channel (str "message from server #" id) false)) ; false => don't close after send
        (recur (inc id))))
    (schedule-task 10000 (close channel)))) ;; close in 10s.

;;; open you browser http://127.0.0.1:9090, a new message show up every 200ms
(run-server handler {:port 9090})
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="websocket" class="anchor">Websocket example</h3>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (on-close channel (fn [status] (println "client close it" status)))
    (on-receive channel (fn [data] ;; echo it back
                          (send! channel data)))))

(run-server handler {:port 9090})
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="channel-group" class="anchor">A utility: ChannelStore</h3>

  <p>I find a utility like ChannelStore(or ChannelGroup) is quite helpful when using the API</p>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defprotocol ChannelStore
  (add-to-group [store group ch attach])
  (remove-from-group [store group ch])
  (broadcast [store group fn]))

;;; implementation using atom.
(deftype MemoryChannelStore [store-map]
  ChannelStore
  (add-to-group [_ group ch attach]
    (swap! store-map (fn [old-store]
                       (assoc old-store
                         group
                         (assoc (or (old-store group) {})
                           ch attach)))))
  (remove-from-group [_ group ch]
    (swap! store-map (fn [old-store]
                       (let [m (update-in old-store [group] dissoc ch)]
                         (if (empty? (m group))
                           (dissoc m group)
                           m)))))
  (broadcast [store group f]
    (doseq [[ch attach] (@store-map group)]
      (if (websocket? ch)
        ;; give back attachment (some state for pass back)
        (send! ch (json-str (f ch attach)))
        (send! ch {:status 200
                   :headers {"Content-Type"
                             "application/json; charset=utf-8"}
                   :body (json-str (f ch attach))}
               true)))))                ; close it

;;; example usage
(defonce channel-store (MemoryChannelStore. (atom {})))
(defn handler [req]
  (let [group (-> req :params :group)
        since_ts (-> req :params :since_ts)] ;; state variable, from client
    (with-channel req ch
      (add-to-group channel-store group ch since_ts)
      (on-close ch (fn [status]
                     (remove-from-group channel-store group ch))))))

;;; some logic in other place
(on-some-event
 (broadcast channel-store a-group
            (fn [ch since_ts] ; since_ts is passed back.
              (some-data-return-to-clients since_ts))))
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>If this is proven to be useful, http-kit can provide a built in more efficient implentation</p>
